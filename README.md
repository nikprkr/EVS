# EVS

### Project Description

This project explores how sex, religious affiliation, and income influence the degree to which respondents agree with the following statements:

- When a mother works for pay, the children suffer
- When jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to [NATIONALITY] people over immigrants

The data used in this analysis was generated as part of the 2017 European Value Study (EVS). 
The EVS is described as "a large-scale, cross-national and longitudinal survey research program on how 
Europeans think about family, work, religion, politics, and society. Repeated every nine years in an increasing 
number of countries, the survey provides insights into the ideas, beliefs, preferences, attitudes, values, and 
opinions of citizens all over Europe."
